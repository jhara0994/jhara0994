## Hi, I'm Jared!

# My Background
#### I have worked in the construction field on and off since I was 16 in various roles including working for myself at times. For the last 3 years, I have worked as an Assistant Director of Operations with duties consisting of managing our tech department, implementing a new website, and overseeing all administrative duties. Recently, I decided that I wanted a change of pace and started Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp on the advice of a close friend that works as a Software Engineer. I have found that I enjoy the challenge of coding and look forward to learning more computer languages once I have mastered Javascript, particularly libraries like Express and React. 
<br>

#### Coding work is both challenging and rewarding and my goal is to build websites and applications that live and function "in the wild." To see code that I have written, debugged, and launched has become a passion of mine, and I like that the possibilities of "What to code?" and "How to code it?" are limitless. I am interested in working in most fields as my goal is to provide solid, working code that can be built on in the future. Feel free to contact me whenever you need help building your next application!
